## About
### Documentation
My main goal for this app was creating easily readable and clean code. I focused on making sure the variables were type safe and the methods/classes had proper doc strings that explained their use succinctly. I felt particularly inspired by the strong type safety of C#, which I have been using a lot for personal projects recently.  
I started out making an SQL database that sorted each subject into its own respective table. I noticed that the output strings were cluttering up my code, so I offloaded them to a json file.
